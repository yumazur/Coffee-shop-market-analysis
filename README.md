# coffee-shop-market-analysis
Project "Opening a coffee shop". Conducted an analysis of the market of public catering establishments in the city of Moscow. To visualize the data obtained, I used several types of graphs (background cartograms, heat maps, bar charts, scatterplots, pie charts, line charts). I revealed the average cost of a cup of cappuccino for each administrative district, found the relationship between the location of coffee houses and the average check, determined the points of concentration of coffee houses and their share from other types of catering flights, depending on their location. Gave recommendations for opening a new coffee shop
