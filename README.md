# Coffee-shop-market-analysis
Project "Opening a coffee shop". Conducted an analysis of the market of public catering establishments in the city of Moscow. To visualize the data obtained, I used several types of graphs (background cartograms, heat maps, bar charts, scatterplots, pie charts, line charts). I revealed the average cost of a cup of cappuccino for each administrative district, found the relationship between the location of coffee houses and the average check, determined the points of concentration of coffee houses and their share from other types of catering flights, depending on their location. Gave recommendations for opening a new coffee shop.

  ### Recommendations for opening a coffee shop:
  Based on the analysis of data on coffee houses in Moscow, the following recommendations can be made to investors who plan to open a coffee house:
1. Location: Explore the possibility of opening a coffee shop in the Central District of the city, as it has the largest number of coffee shops and high traffic. This will provide more opportunities to attract customers and increase the chances of success.
2. Number of seats: Analyze data on the number of seats in existing coffee shops. Please note that most coffee shops have less than 80 seats, but there is a significant scatter in the data. Further research, including field studies, is recommended to determine the optimal number of seats for a new establishment.
3. Coffee chains: Consider competition from coffee chains. Pay attention to the top 5 coffee chains, which are most represented in the Central District. Study their successful practices and competitive advantages to attract customers and stand out from the competition.
4. 24/7 Operation: Consider opening a 24/7 coffee shop. The presence of 24-hour establishments indicates high traffic and active nightlife in the area. This can attract additional customers and increase revenue.
5. Coffee prices: Determine coffee prices based on the median values for each county. Please note that the Central and Western districts have the highest prices. The cost of a cup of coffee should be competitive, but give a decent profitability.
6. Quality of Service: Given the high competition in the coffee shop industry, investors should pay special attention to the quality of service. Provide a high level of customer service and make it one of the key success factors for your establishment.
7. Marketing and Advertising: Develop an effective marketing and advertising strategy for your coffee shop. Use social media, create an attractive website and actively promote your establishment in accordance with the preferences of your target audience. Develop a loyalty program to attract and retain customers.
